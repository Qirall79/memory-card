# Memory Card

This is a simple memory game with The Phantom Troupe from anime Hunter x Hunter theme.
Once you click a card, the cards will be rerolled, you should never click that card again or else you lose and your score will be reset to 0. 
The maximum score is 10 since there are 10 cards.

I built this project in order to practice using Lifecycle Methods and Hooks, as well as Tailwind Css.
